Logging
========================

When you're working in your notebook and something goes awry, the issue could be your data schema, the choices you made while building a chart, or something else. To understand what went wrong, check the logs! 

PixieDust comes complete with logging to help you troubleshoot issues. To invoke it, just enter the following command in a notebook cell and run:

``%pixiedustLog -l debug``

PixieDust shows you a log of recent activities.
